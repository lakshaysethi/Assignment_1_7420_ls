now working on task # 2
- working on  `getTimeslotBooking(String licenceNumber)`(20 marks) (DONE)function - I have already coded it using other fucntions so its simple to implement, however I need to use it somewhere as well so I did use it in the `— bookTimeslot(String licenceNumber, String day, int hour)` (20marks)(DONE) function and now just need to test if everything still works time.Now() = 5:56pm
    - yes everything still works    


@6:02pm
- Now working on "Get a list of summary data for timeslot bookings on a given day  `getSlots(String day) ` (20 marks)Return a sequence of hours, bookingCounts ordered by hour"
    - so this will be basically `ArrayList<Slot> daySlots getSlots(String day)` in my code - ok  
    - yeah that was easy - i had already implemented other methods that helped me  :)  `like slot.getDateString()` so this is also (DONE)     
    

Now   
@6:13pm   

-Need to make the Hotspots UI(10 marks) ok 

- need to learn about how to use TableLayout damn
- so this table layout is kinda you know uses a lot of hard coding - i want to be able to choose the number of rows and columns programatically and just go from there @ 6:34pm 
- I am stuck in research mode!-this might take some time which I dont want to waste
- according to this website I can Do it programatically -https://technotzz.wordpress.com/2011/11/04/android-dynamically-add-rows-to-table-layout/ time.now()= 6:46pm - TOOK 1/2 hr - this felt like just 2-3 minutes

@9:09pm    
still working on the Mobile assignment 
- i added super user abilities and forcing the right orientation till 9:15pm
- shared the code with friends to get feedback while also marking it by myself for last 45 mins - this is too much time for this task Time now is 10:05pm 
- need to write Unit tests for the android app- but I do not know anything about unit tests - i need to learn it.- I will do it later.
-also it would be good if I sent an email to Jong Casy telling him i am finished with the app :)
- this was a simple app but it took too much time for me to make it.
- I can make this app better and improve it.


- I want to make more android apps- I like the challenge and I like to learn and create but there has to be a challenge and it should be achieveable 
- this project put me in a flow state.
