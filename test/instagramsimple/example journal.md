Going to work on Task #5, to try and implement saving user data to text files.
Estimate: 30 minutes
Got a bug, file isn’t being created correctly.
5:15PM Still stuck on bug. Switching to Task #7 to add a button.
5:45PM Added a button, closed Task #7.
7PM: Fixed bug with file not being created. I was accidentally saving it to the wrong
directory.
Future Suggestion: Make sure to always check which directory I save files to.
Actual time taken: ~4 hours.
7:30PM: Need to create an Invoice class which has save() method.
Estimate: 1hr
Stopped @ 9pm.

March 24th 2020 – 10AM
Continuing on Task #6 from yesterday – Creating class for Invoice
10:30AM: Finished class for Invoice (Task #6).
Actual time taken: ~2 hours.
10:45AM: Debug Issue #12 – Game collisions aren’t working and object disappears
off screen.
Estimate: 4 hours
1PM: While debugging game collisions I realized that I forgot to enable logging. I
enabled logging and instantly saw why collisions weren’t working. I wasn’t checking if
a collision occurred before moving the object.
Future Suggestion: When creating classes, start with a list of pseudo-code comments
of things I need to remember to check. Also don’t forget to enable logging when
debugging.
Actual time taken: ~2 hours
2PM: Refactored / rewrote the do_stuff() function to be smaller and more clear.
4PM: Found a StackOverflow post for a possible solution to Task #9:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1077347/hello-world-in-python
5PM: Solution didn’t work. Out of time for this feature so will cut it and work on a
different task.
Etc.. Write in your journal and work on your code daily.
